1. What is async-await ??
ans: aasync is a key word which makes a function async, This async function is use to handle promises
     inside it.
     Await is keyword used inside async function.
     Bith together used to handle promises by making Js asynchronous.
     And then explain with some example.

Syntactical sugar

2. async/await vs .then()/.catch()
ans: This async-await is just a "syntactical sugar" over .then()/.catch(). Code inside async function 
     is treated with .then()/.catch() by JS under the hood.
     So both are same, both are batter, No one is batter than other.
