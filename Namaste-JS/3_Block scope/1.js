// Block
// Below is a valid block which does nothing
/**
 * 
{
    // Also called as group of statements or compound statement
}
*/

// Defination: We can use block in js to combine multiple statement where js expects single statement

// For example if statement expects single statement as return
if (true) console.log(Aditya);
// But for giving here multiple statements block is used
if (true) {
  console.log("Aditya");
  console.log("Namra");
}

/**
 Here in above code this is calld a block
 {
  console.log("Aditya");
  console.log("Namra");
}
 */
